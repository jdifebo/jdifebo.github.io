	<h1>Joe's Projects</h1>
	<p>
		Hi, I'm Joe DiFebo. I'm currently a software developer living in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I'm currently doing full-stack web
		development. Every few months I'll get really motivated for a week or two and make something cool in my free time. Here
		is some of the stuff I have worked on!
	</p>

	<h3>WordMaker</h3>
	<p>
		A program that generates made-up words based on a provided list of actual words. It uses Markov chains to learn which letters
		are commonly used together, and then it generates new words based on these patterns. By learning from different word lists,
		the words that it generates can be very different!
